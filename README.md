## arima_guide
A mathematical deep dive into making the most of your ARIMA models with parameteric tuning.

### Dataset
For the purpose of this primer we will be demonstrating most of our transformation and modeling on the 'Sales of shampoo over a three year period' dataset that was acquired from [DataMarket](https://datamarket.com/data/set/22r0/sales-of-shampoo-over-a-three-year-period).

### Setup
To follow along with the walkthrough, ensure that you have a functional Jupyter Notebook environment with the following packages at the very least:
+ numpy
+ pandas
+ seaborn(and matplotlib)
+ statsmodels

If you are missing any of the following packages use the following command structure to install with pip.
> pip install numpy pandas seaborn statsmodels
